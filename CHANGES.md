# Changes

## 2025-02-11 v0.0.2

* Improved handling of location in MessageList class:
  * Use assistant system prompt (`assistant_system_prompt`) for adding location
    to message list, if no system prompt was defined.
  * Updated spec to cover new behavior.
* Simplified configuration defaults to be stored in `default_config.yml`:
  - Replaced `DEFAULT_CONFIG` hash with a single line of code that reads from
    `default_config.yml`
  - Created new file `default_config.yml` in the same directory, containing the
    old `DEFAULT_CONFIG` hash values
  - Updated `initialize` method to use the new `default_config.yml` file if no
    filename is provided
