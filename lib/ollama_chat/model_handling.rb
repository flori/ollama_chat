# A module that provides functionality for managing Ollama models, including
# checking model availability, pulling models from remote servers, and handling
# model presence verification.
#
# This module encapsulates the logic for interacting with Ollama models,
# ensuring that required models are available locally before attempting to use
# them in chat sessions. It handles both local model verification and remote
# model retrieval when necessary.
#
# @example Checking if a model is present
#   chat.model_present?('llama3.1')
#
# @example Pulling a model from a remote server
#   chat.pull_model_from_remote('mistral')
#
# @example Ensuring a model is available locally
#   chat.pull_model_unless_present('phi3', {})
module OllamaChat::ModelHandling
  # The model_present? method checks if the specified Ollama model is available.
  #
  # @param model [ String ] the name of the Ollama model
  #
  # @return [ String, FalseClass ] the system prompt if the model is present,
  # false otherwise
  def model_present?(model)
    ollama.show(model:) { return _1.system.to_s }
  rescue Ollama::Errors::NotFoundError
    false
  end

  # The pull_model_from_remote method attempts to retrieve a model from the
  # remote server if it is not found locally.
  #
  # @param model [ String ] the name of the model to be pulled
  #
  # @return [ nil ]
  def pull_model_from_remote(model)
    STDOUT.puts "Model #{bold{model}} not found locally, attempting to pull it from remote nowâ€¦"
    ollama.pull(model:)
  end

  # The pull_model_unless_present method checks if the specified model is
  # present on the system.
  #
  # If the model is already present, it returns the system prompt if it is
  # present.
  #
  # Otherwise, it attempts to pull the model from the remote server using the
  # pull_model_from_remote method. If the model is still not found after
  # pulling, it exits the program with a message indicating that the model was
  # not found remotely.
  #
  # @param model [ String ] The name of the model to check for presence.
  # @param options [ Hash ] Options for the pull_model_from_remote method.
  #
  # @return [ String, FalseClass ] the system prompt if the model and it are
  # present, false otherwise.
  def pull_model_unless_present(model, options)
    if system = model_present?(model)

    else
